Description: HiCool provides an R interface to process and normalize Hi-C 
    paired-end fastq reads into .(m)cool files. 
    .(m)cool is a compact, indexed HDF5 file format specifically tailored for 
    efficiently storing HiC-based data. 
    On top of processing fastq reads, HiCool provies a convenient reporting 
    function to generate shareable reports summarizing Hi-C experiments and 
    including quality controls.
